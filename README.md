# Boredom Jar
Do you get bored often and resort to doing things that end up dulling your mind?

Here is a web app that will help you.

It is called the "Boredom Jar"

### This is how it works:

1. Write out a list of at least 15 things you can do when you are bored that will set your mind free or on fire.

**It is best to focus on activities are not high dopamine based like social media, games or movies.**

That is because if you use high dopamine stuff to solve your boredom problem, you will just end up needing more and more of it until there is very little that can satisfy you and this will affect your work productivity and other areas of your life.

You can write down things like:

- Read a chapter of xyz book
- Explore midjourney page and play with some new ideas
- Go for a walk.
- Take a Bath
- (optional) You can even take this further by avoiding any activity that requires a device.

2. Determine the freiquency of each "activity".

E.g. Let's say one of those activities is "take a bath" - You write it out like 5 times or more.

3. Add the activities to the jar.

4. Anytime you are feeling bored, instead of opening social media or doing any other high dopamine stuff, reach out for the jar, pick one a random activity and do whatever activity is in it.

**Now, there is a rule guiding this.**

**Anytime you reach out for the jar and pick one of the papers in it, YOU MUST DO WHATEVER the paper you pick says.**

That is what makes it powerful.

TRY IT!
